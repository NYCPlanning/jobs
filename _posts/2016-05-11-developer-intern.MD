The platform will provide analysis and presentation of data from all facets of Capital Planning across New York City, including parks, streets, schools, public facilities, etc.  

Assistance is needed across the entire stack, so an intern could work on web frontend, web backend, database/data management, or all of these combined.  

The development team in Capital Planning is using free and open source software and rapid development tools & practices in the creation of this platform. The following technical skills are preferred:

**Frontend**

**Backend**

Node.js, API design & deveopment with express.js, PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial queries, documentation development, web authentication practices etc

**Database Management** 

Familiarity with ETL tools and processes, data loading, PDF data scraping, screen scraping, PostgreSQL and PostGIS database design & management

Interns will be expected to work collaboratively, participate in planning and feature discussions, and to contribute to the codebase through git pull requests.


**Other notes about the position**

- This is an unpaid internship
- Dates are flexible, this can be a summer engagement or longer
- Interns would be expected to work at least 24 hours a week
- Interns should be physically present in New York City and spend part of their time in the DCP office at 120 Broadway in Manhattan, but the team will collaborate online so remote work is possible
