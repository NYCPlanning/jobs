This role reports to the [Chief Operating Officer](http://a856-gbol.nyc.gov/GBOLWebsite/GreenBook/Details?orgId=2902)

####THE AGENCY 

The [Department of City Planning (DCP)](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/index.page) promotes strategic growth, transit‐oriented development and sustainable communities to enhance quality of life in the City, in part by initiating comprehensive, consensus‐based planning and zoning changes for individual neighborhoods and business districts, as well as establishing policies and zoning regulations applicable citywide. DCP also supports the City Planning Commission in its annual review of approximately 450 land use applications for actions such aszoning changes, special permits and a variety of other discretionary approvals. In addition, the Department assists both government agencies and the public by providing policy analysis and technical assistance relating to housing, transportation, community facilities, demography, zoning, urban design, waterfront areas and public open space.

Under Housing New York: A Five-Borough, Ten Year Plan, the Department will lead coordinated, ground up neighborhood planning studies and advance regulatory changes—including mandatory inclusionary housing in newly rezoned areas—to promote more economically diverse communities and housing opportunities for New Yorkers at all income levels. Through inclusive community development initiatives with stakeholders, DCP will expand access to quality jobs and services, and stimulate economic development benefitting all New Yorkers. In addition, DCP is committed to expanding public access to land use, housing and population data and planning resources through its online Community Portal, as well as to support informed participation by New Yorkers in neighborhood planning and land use review processes. 

####THE ROLE 

Reporting to the Chief Operating Officer, the CIO will set the overall technological vision and a clear set of IT priorities for the Agency. The CIO will manage five IT sections within DCP, which in aggregate provide essential support and applications to advance the Agency’s policy agenda as well as its Charter-mandated activity such as approving land use applications. The Chief Information Officer will be responsible for the entirety of the Agency’s technology projects, programs, data sets and initiatives, including the roughly 50 staff that lead or perform these activities today. See attached sheet for description of the existing sections and teams of the IT division. 

The CIO will be joining at an exciting time for DCP and the IT Division. S/he will be responsible for leading the department through two priority initiatives: 

1. *The implementation of a ‘Paperless Filing’ system:* the Agency will be engaging a system integrator for the development of a multi-million dollar platform for applicants to submit land use applications electronically; this platform will also allow the Agency to more seamlessly manage workflow and documents related to the 500+ applications moving through the Department at any one point in time. While an external vendor is leading the development, IT staff will be fully integrated into the development team throughout the design and build phases of the system, and will be responsible for managing and enhancing it going forward. 

2. *The development and implementation of a DCP IT Strategic Plan:* This plan should advance a ‘customer-centric’ approach to technological investments and a specific work program for IT staff, based on a holistic understanding of the Agency’s mission, its ongoing needs and additional opportunities for productivity and effectiveness across its varied divisions. The plan should clarify the roles and responsibilities for managing crucial datasets and software across the agency, and to identify what additional training and skills are necessary for DCP to maintain its IT leadership position in a rapidly evolving technology environment. 

Subsequent to the release of this IT Strategic Plan, the CIO is also expected to keep a pulse on the evolving needs of our critical planning divisions, and to identify, propose and introduce new technology-based solutions to help the Agency advance its overall agenda, or to become more productive in delivering it. Ongoing supervision and management of the program of work by the CIO will ensure new programs and enhancements are delivered on-time and on-budget. 

This position will be responsible for oversight of the implementation and integration of any new computer systems and their respective architectures. The CIO shall weigh in on hardware, software and support decisions for the agency as related to information technology. It is expected the CIO will also ensure responsible, timely, IT spend forecasts and budget monitoring, with cost-effective specification choices and a regular evaluation of additional cost saving opportunities. 

The CIO is also responsible for the professional development of all IT staff. This includes thoughtful consideration of skills and training needs given the goals of the division, and aligned hiring, and retention and promotion policies. The CIO will ensure staff understand the divisional goals, and are motivated to contribute at a consistently high level. 

As with any City agency IT department, relationships with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications (DoITT) are critical to cost efficiencies and technological effectiveness. The CIO will build collaborative, effective relationships with various DoITT divisions, and ensure relevant learnings are shared broadly through the IT organizations. The CIO is also expected to foster constructive working relationships with CIOs in our partner agencies and to pursue interagency projects to promote the city’s growth, vitality and equity. The CIO will be committed to sharing City Planning data and information with partners and the public through the agency and city’s open data platforms. 

####DEPARTMENT OF CITY PLANNING IT DIVISIONAL OVERVIEW 
**PC and Network Services (PCNS)**

PCNS provides services related to all agency computer hardware and software, and is responsible for managing the local and wide area networks at the six City Planning office locations. Services include telecommunication with CityNet (NYC’s network used for mainframe access, email services, video, and other data transmissions among City agencies), with the Internet, and to agency issued hand held devices. 

PCNS is responsible for maintaining network security. This includes maintaining back-up systems on all agency servers, complying with citywide security directives, and cooperating with City oversight agencies to protect against deliberate and accidental system corruption. PCNS procures and maintains network hardware and operating systems that are upgraded as technology changes and new services are required. 

PCNS also provides and maintains the personal computers and related hardware and software in City Planning. The Help Desk/Desktop Support staff responds to requests for help and assistance with computer related problems. PCNS also evaluates new needs for hardware and/or software. Technicians research and evaluate products, and recommend cost effective solutions. 

**Database and Application Development (DAD)** 

DAD is responsible for designing, developing and maintaining the agency’s major computer databases and applications. 

DAD’s major systems include mainframe and server-hosted applications that track the agency’s land use and environmental review processes. Over the next 18 months, DAD staff will work closely with contractor staff to redesign and build a new system to support online applications and seamless cross-divisional review. 

DAD collects, processes, and provides land use, housing, economic and demographic data that are used for developing neighborhood and community development plans, major citywide studies, and tax revenues and economic studies. Data maintained by DAD include 
- a tax lot (parcel) zoning database
- PLUTO - a database of land use, geographic and zoning information derived from data maintained by several NYC agencies. PLUTO is used by staff throughout city government and by hundreds of users in the public via the open data offerings on the department’s website. 

DAD builds and maintains other databases and applications to support the work of the department’s divisions. 

**Geographic Systems Section (GSS)** 

GSS designs, develops and maintains specialized geographic computer applications and files. The Geosupport System is a citywide service that standardizes and validates locations (such as addresses, tax lots, buildings and street intersections) and relates these to political and administrative districts. It is used by over 40 city agencies for their operational and planning activities. Geosupport is available on Windows-based PCs and servers, IBM Mainframes and on Linux servers. Server and web-based applications can access any of these versions through a tool called (GeoX), or through DoITT’s GeoClient API (Geosupport in the Cloud). 

GSS’ geographic research unit maintains a wide range of GIS datasets and related data files. These include the LION street center line file, various political and administrative district boundaries, and the Property Address Directory (PAD) which contains geographic information about NYC’s approximately one million tax lots and the buildings on them. GSS also maintains (with DoITT) the Citywide Street Centerline file (CSCL). 

**Web Team** 
The Web Team is responsible for the design, development and maintenance of DCP’s website, [www.nyc.gov/planning](http://www.nyc.gov/planning). The team coordinates with DoITT to assure adherence with citywide standards and requirements for the website. The web team works with staff throughout the agency and the executive office to assure that information is timely and accurate. 

The Web Team is also responsible for the department’s intranet site, DCP Commons and builds web applications, often in collaboration with programmers and database developers from the GIS Team and the DAD and GSS sections. 

**GIS Team** 

The GIS Team maintains the data and application infrastructure used by DCP’s staff for desktop geographic inquiry and analysis. The team manages the ArcGIS/SQL Server database of geographic data used in developing plans, analyzing land use applications and providing related information to the public. The team members also coordinate with other agencies to provide geographic data resources that support the agency’s work. 

Customized applications and interfaces are developed by the team to enhance the access to, and use of, the various geographic resources both within the agency and for the public. 

The team provides assistance in the use of the geographic information and software for agency planning and community development initiatives, and leads agency-wide GIS Users’ Group meetings.
